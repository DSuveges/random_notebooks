PMC6349230	Ahn found that lentinan attenuates AIM2 and non‐canonical inflammation while increasing pro‐inflammatory cytokines via TLR.51 In the current study, we found that lentinan down‐regulated LPS‐induced TLR4‐mediated NF‐κB signalling pathway and the expression of various inflammatory cytokines, which are key factors in leucocyte extravasation, colitis and CAC.52 For example, it reduced the expression of IL‐13 and CD30L, which are two key factors in IBD and CAC.53, 54 We suppose that the inflammation‐modulating properties of lentinan may vary depending on cell type and the inflammatory microenvironment.

PMC5441536	At the beginning of 2016, scientists at the Broad Institute have finally unraveled the major risk locus from the PGC-schizophrenia GWAS: by an elegant integration of GWAS data with information on the effect of genetic variants on brain gene expression, they have identified a complement pathway component (C4A) as the causal gene for the robust association.7 Given the implication of C4A in synaptic elimination during post-natal development, this finding provides a robust genetic support to the longstanding theory of excessive synaptic pruning in schizophrenia, postulated back in 1982 (see ref. 8).

PMC5044511	Both are thought to be potential contributors to the central nervous system pathology in schizophrenia (Nawa et al., 2000; Roussos et al., 2012). PRKCE is involved in nerve growth factor (NFG)-induced neurite outgrowth and neuron morphological change. CNTNAP2 may play a major role in the formation of functionally distinct domains critical for saltatory conduction of nerve impulses in myelinated nerve fibers and, therefore, its epigenetic alteration is consistent with the hypothesis that schizophrenia results from poor or miswired anatomical or functional connections (Salgado-Pineda et al., 2007).

PMC6504231	IL-21 also can promote the differentiation of Th17 cells (Korn et al., 2007; Nurieva et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2007), is required for the normal development of T follicular helper cells (Vogelzang et al., 2008) and optimal Th2 responses to helminth infection (Fröhlich et al., 2007; Pesce et al., 2006), has potent activity as an anti-tumor agent (Skak et al., 2008; Spolski and Leonard, 2014), and promotes the development of a range of autoimmune diseases (Bubier et al., 2009; Kwok et al., 2012; Spolski et al., 2008), suggesting that blocking IL-21 may be a therapeutic approach in such diseases.

PI3K pathway inhibition, a central pathway downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), such as HER2 (Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2), promotes biventricular remodeling with reduced left ventricular (LV) mass and right ventricular (RV) dilation and reduced ejection fraction (EF) in the setting of chemotherapy involving wasting syndrome (cachexia), MAPK (p38 mitogen‐activated protein kinase) activation, and oxidation‐reduction stress.

PMC2327086	In fact, remarkable improvements in pathological condition in the lung and in survival rate of virus-infected mice were observed with l-NMMA, and with the O2– scavenger SOD and the XO inhibitor allopurinol as well.34,38 Furthermore, a therapeutic effect on influenza pathogenesis was found with a selenium-containing organic compound, ebselen (unpublished observation), which shows potent ONOO–-scavenging action.94 The beneficial effects of these pharmacological interventions indicate that ONOO– could be an important molecular species in the pathogenesis of influenza virus-induced pneumonia in mice.

PMC6349211	In the past decade, dozens of autotaxin inhibitors have been developed, some of which are now in phase‐II clinical trials for treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and breast cancer.38 For example, ONO‐8430506, a tetrahydrocarboline derivative with an IC50 of 5 nmol/L for inhibition of plasma autotaxin activity can delay initial tumour growth by 60% in Balb/c mice with orthotopic 4T1 breast tumours and markedly reduced the subsequent lung and liver metastasis.39 Therefore, our study suggested autotaxin/LPA signalling was also a potential target for improving cardiomyopathy in obese condition.

PMC6517859	Ischemia eventually leads to the production of VEGF that activates tyrosine kinase receptors, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2.22 VEGF is a growth factor and potent vasoactive cytokine that promotes angiogenesis, breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier, and induces endothelial cell growth and neovascularization.23,24 Matsuoka et al.25 reported that expression of VEGF in diabetic retinas was significantly increased while Funatsu et al.26 suggested that VEGF levels in vitreous and plasma were elevated in diabetic patients with retinopathy when compared to normal subjects and diabetic patients without retinopathy.

PMC4575407	Key mediators of spontaneous HCV clearance are virus-specific T cells (reviewed in71), which remain readily detectable in the circulation for decades after clearance.72 Studies in chimpanzees were important to demonstrate that these T cells protect upon reinfection because depletion of either CD4 or CD8 T cells after recovery from a primary challenge abrogates protective immunity upon HCV rechallenge.73,74 Based on the fact that acute HCV infection can be cleared spontaneously, effective antiviral therapy of chronic infection should be able to completely eliminate HCV without the risk of relapse.

PMC5738517	MCP-1 is involved in the defect of Th2 cell polarity[8] and also affects the generation of interleukin-4 (IL-4), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and interleukin-12 (IL-12).[9] The alterations of peripheral IL-4, IFN-γ, and IL-12 levels in schizophrenia patients indicates that MCP-1 might be associated with Th1/Th2 dysfunction in schizophrenia.[10] More interestingly, some studies showed the SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) subtypes, rs4795893, rs1024611, rs4586 and rs2857657, of CCL2, the coding gene of MCP-1, were associated with treatment resistance of risperidone in the Han Chinese population.[11]	Wrong split

PMC2627933	Previous studies of ileal mucus in CF neonates with MI have demonstrated increased fucosylation. [42], [43] CF gene knockout mice, whose main pathology is intestinal mucous obstruction, have increased fucosylation and increased FUT2 expression.[44] In a small study of homo- and heterozygous ΔF508 patients, presence of both functional secretor and Lewis genes was associated with meconium ileus. [45] These studies lead us to hypothesize that MI in CF patients may be related to glycosylation patterns/ABH status; however, no difference in prevalence of ABH genotypes was found between the two groups.

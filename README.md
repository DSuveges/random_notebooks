# Random jupyter notebooks

This is just a collection of some notebooks I worked on or prototyping various things hobby projects.



## Tickets

* **[issue-1166_benchmarking_clingen_evidences](issue-1166_benchmarking_clingen_evidences)**: checking score distribution of ClinGen evidence strings

* **[issue-1249_prototyping_new_json_schema](issue-1249_prototyping_new_json_schema)**: as part of the rewrite efforts the evidence input was re-structured. To formulate these changes a new schema was developed reflecting the new requirements.


## Quick tasks

* **[2020.09.15_checking_intact_data](2020.09.15_checking_intact_data)**: the first release of the networks data dump is being checked. Just to see if everything is alright.

* **[2020.10.01_EVA_scoring](2020.10.01_EVA_scoring)**: during the summer the EVA sourced genetic evidence was re-structured, new values were added. In this notebooks I inverstigated if these new values can be used to improve scoring to provide a better drug-target prioritization.

* **[2020.10.06_testing_new_networks_data_release](2020.10.06_testing_new_networks_data_release)**: to make sure the previously found issues are fixed an other round of checks were applied.

* **[2021.02.15_release_check_clingen](2021.02.15_release_check_clingen)**: the 21.02 release introduced a moderate number of new ClinGen evidence. The aim of this task was to find out if any of these new evidence mean a totally new association not yet supported by any other genetic evidence.


## Random little projects

* **[2020.12.30_visual_tests](2020.12.30_visual_tests)**: this exercise helped to develop new ways to visualize the number of different projects, their scales over the years.

* **[HMRC_scambaiting](HMRC_scambaiting)**: This is just a small script to automate fooding scammers' database with fake data. This was the time I learnt about the [faker](https://faker.readthedocs.io/) library. That is just an amazing tool.
